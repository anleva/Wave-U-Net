# Wave-U-Net Examples

The Wave-U-Net takes raw audio in stereo as input, which is a series of floats between -1 and +1.
The original paper reached very good results, but as I write this, my net explains only around 80 per cent of the target sound.

One short example is available, with both the original input mix, the two target separations, as well as the output of the trained net.
